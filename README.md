# Vardas

Biblioteka skirta paversti lietuviškus vardus iš vardininko linksnio į bet kurį kitą.

## Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
3. To test out the package, open `dist/` dir, run `yarn link` (npm link also works, but yarn is easier to setup here). Then open up another project, maybe a dummy project, and run `yarn link vardas`, this act as if vardas package was installed through npm, and you can test it out in real time.
